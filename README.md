## Description

For this study guide, the main focus was learning the very beginning knowledge on this fun little coding adventure. Saying that almost makes it seem childish, but I feel like its really anything but. Sort of crazy that someone invented computer language. It's like a language in a language that makes machine do stuff. Wild stuff.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I'm honestly not sure how much I'll be using this. I'll probably use it as a bench mark sort of thing. LIke, in the future when I actually know what I'm doing, I'll come back and look at this and laugh at what an idiot I was. Looking forward to that.
